# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Study Guide was created to keep track of notes I took during the prework.
It collects and organizes concepts introduced during the prework modules.
The concepts and technologies include HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I took these concepts and applied them to this study guide website to expand my knowledge of web development. I now have a place to record future concepts and technologies introduced throughout the bootcamp course.

To use this study guide, you can review notes in each section. First, visit the webpage and open the DevTools by pressing Control+Shift+I (Windows) or Command+Option+I (MacOS).
Next in the DevTools go to the **console** tab. The JavaScript will rerun everytime the page is refreshed and it will randomly pick one of the four sections for you to study.
